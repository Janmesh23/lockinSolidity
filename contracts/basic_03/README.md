Great question.

Let’s now go **fundamental**:

---

## 🔷 In Solidity: **How is Input Taken?**

Inputs are values passed into a contract to modify or read data.

Inputs can be provided in 2 main ways:

---

### ✅ 1. **Via Constructor** (Only Once – At Deployment)

**Used when you want to initialize values once during contract deployment.**

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    string public name;

    constructor(string memory _name) {
        name = _name; // input taken only at deployment
    }
}
```

#### Usage:

* From Remix: Fill constructor input when deploying.
* From Script: Pass argument to `deploy()` function.

🟡 **One-time input** → can't be changed later unless you make a function for it.

---

### ✅ 2. **Via Public/External Functions** (Any Time – After Deployment)

**Most inputs are taken via functions** after deployment.

```solidity
contract Voting {
    string public candidate;

    function setCandidate(string memory _name) public {
        candidate = _name;
    }
}
```

#### Usage:

* Can be called many times with different inputs.
* Used for user interactions, transactions, logic changes, etc.

🟢 **Most real-world dApps take input this way.**

## 🔹 Other Forms of Inputs

| Type                 | When Used                               | Example                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **constructor**      | When deploying contract                 | Initializing owner, name, supply |
| **functions**        | Anytime after deployment                | `vote()`, `transfer()`, `mint()` |
| **modifiers**        | Used to restrict input, not accept      | `onlyOwner`, `inState(State.X)`  |
| **fallback/receive** | When no function matches or sending ETH | `receive() external payable`     |
| **events**           | Not for input, but for logging          | `emit Action("input")`           |

## 🔷 Summary

| Input Method    | Use Case                              | Mutable? | When Called    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| `constructor()` | Initialize on deployment (like setup) | ❌ No     | Once at deploy |
| `function()`    | User interaction (change/read state)  | ✅ Yes    | Any time after |

---

✅ **Conclusion**:

> You usually take inputs via **functions**.
> Use `constructor` only for **one-time setup** when deploying the contract.

Would you like a contract showing **constructor input + user function input** together for clarity?
